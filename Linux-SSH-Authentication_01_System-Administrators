###Task
The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up some scripts on jump host that run on regular intervals and perform operations on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. To make these scripts work properly we need to make sure the thor user on jump host has password-less SSH access to all app servers through their respective sudo users (i.e tony for app server 1). Based on the requirements, perform the following:

Set up a password-less authentication from user thor on jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.

###Solution
#On Jump Server create a key :

ssh-keygen -t rsa

#Jump to all Nautilus App servers and acticate the password-less SSH access :
ssh-copy-id tony@stapp01
Ir0nM@n

ssh-copy-id steve@stapp02
Am3ric@

ssh-copy-id banner@stapp03
BigGr33n

#Test to logging into the App servers without password :
ssh tony@stapp01
ssh steve@stapp02
ssh banner@stapp03
